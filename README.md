This demo script implements a Reminder Class that can be used to periodical remind somebody of some task. 

Different intervals are possible:

1) Daily
Option to skip weekends or weekdays
2) Weekly
3) Monthly
Here various options are available to specify the day.

Longer intervals were not implemented.

The script uses datetime and is timezone naive.

The database storage and email sending was not implemented as this would be specific to the usecase. I used this in a Django App.
